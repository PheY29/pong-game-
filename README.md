Here's my first game after having seen the basics of pygame and python in general since early 2023 and made in just under 1 month of development because there were holidays, Christmas etc (started December 14, 2023 and finished January 17, 2024).

To get started and learn, I started with a pong (classic version) and wanted to improve it as much as possible.
I had some objectives in mind to make a "special" version:
- full management with different menus :
  startin menu : choose your mode, then if you want to play alone or against the ia as you can see above, a pause menu and a winning menu

- several game modes (randomly chosen) 
- try my hand at animations and other pixel art

- try my hand at the mask principle (with sprites for balls and paddles)
- and other things

I think there's a lot of code that could be optimized, and I'd be delighted to get feedback if people drop by and give it a try (I'm French, but I've done my best to make it as English as possible, so I hope it'll be readable for everyone).
